Recommander - Sustainable Alternative for Clothing 

The Environmental Cost of Fashion
The clothing industry represents an important part of our economies, with a value of  USD 1.3 trillion and employing over 300 million people along the value chain (Ellen MacArthur Foundation). In the last 20 years, global fibre production has almost doubled from 58 million tonnes in 2000 to 116 million tonnes in 2022, and is expected to continue to grow to 147 million tonnes in 2030 if business as usual continues (Textile Exchange 2023). While people bought 60% more garments in 2014 than in 2000, they only kept the clothes for half as long (McKinsey & Company, 2016).

While the fashion sector is booming, increasing attention has been brought to the impressive range of negative environmental impacts that the industry is responsible for. The fashion industry is the second-biggest consumer of water and is responsible for 2-8 % of global carbon emissions.

Whatâ€™s more, 85% of all textiles go to the dump each year (UNECE, 2018), and washing some types of clothes sends significant amount of microplastics into the ocean.
