Recommander - Sustainable Alternative for Clothing 

The Environmental Cost of Fashion
The clothing industry represents an important part of our economies, with a value of  USD 1.3 trillion and employing over 300 million people along the value chain (Ellen MacArthur Foundation). In the last 20 years, global fibre production has almost doubled from 58 million tonnes in 2000 to 116 million tonnes in 2022, and is expected to continue to grow to 147 million tonnes in 2030 if business as usual continues (Textile Exchange 2023). While people bought 60% more garments in 2014 than in 2000, they only kept the clothes for half as long (McKinsey & Company, 2016).

While the fashion sector is booming, increasing attention has been brought to the impressive range of negative environmental impacts that the industry is responsible for : 

- The equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothes is burned or dumped in a landfill every second (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017)

- Approximately 60% of all materials used by the fashion industry are made from plastic (UNEP, 2019) 500,000 tons of microfibers are released into the ocean each year from washing clothes â€” the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017)
 
- The fashion industry is responsible for 2-8 % of global carbon emissions. If the fashion sector continues on its current trajectory, that share of the carbon budget could jump to 26% by 2050 (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017)
  
- Each year, the textile value chain uses 215 trillion litres of water per year (the equivalent of 86 million Olympic-sized swimming pools ) (Quantis, 2018). Around 20% of industrial wastewater pollution worldwide originates from the fashion industry (Word Bank, 2020)

  
Less than 1% of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing, resulting in over $100 billion in material value loss (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). The Circularity Gap Report Textiles (2024) finds that  only 0.3% of 3.25 billion tonnes of resources each year to produce items from the global textile industry comes from recycled resources
An extra $20-30 billion annually is needed to make the textile value chain more sustainable, with 60% focused on energy, water, and waste issues alone (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017)
